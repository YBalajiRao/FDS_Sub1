ðŸ“š Foundations of Data Science â€“ Unit 1
ðŸ“– Overview
This unit introduces the fundamental concepts, methods, and tools in data science.
You will learn how to handle data, visualize it, explore its patterns, and understand the basic statistical foundations that power data-driven decision making.

1. Introduction to Data Science
What is Data Science? â€“ Definition, scope, applications.

Types of Data â€“ Structured, unstructured, semi-structured.

Data Science Workflow â€“ Data collection â†’ preprocessing â†’ analysis â†’ visualization â†’ modeling â†’ evaluation.

Importance in real-world scenarios â€“ healthcare, business, science, AI.

2. Causality and Experiments
Causality vs Correlation â€“ Difference and importance.

Controlled Experiments â€“ Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs).

Observational Studies â€“ When experiments are not possible.

Confounding Variables â€“ How they affect conclusions.

3. Data Preprocessing
3.1 Data Cleaning
Handling missing values.

Removing duplicates.

Correcting inconsistent data formats.

Dealing with outliers.

3.2 Data Reduction
Dimensionality reduction (PCA basics).

Sampling strategies.

Feature selection.

3.3 Data Transformation
Normalization & Standardization.

Encoding categorical variables.

Aggregation and scaling.

3.4 Data Discretization
Converting continuous data into categories (binning).

Equal-width vs Equal-frequency binning.

4. Visualization and Graphing
4.1 Visualizing Categorical Distributions
Bar charts, Pie charts, Count plots.

4.2 Visualizing Numerical Distributions
Histograms, Boxplots, Violin plots, Density plots.

4.3 Overlaid Graphs
Multiple distributions in one plot for comparison.

4.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation).

Identifying trends, patterns, anomalies.

5. Randomness & Probability
Concept of randomness.

Probability basics (events, outcomes, probability rules).

Conditional probability & Bayesâ€™ theorem (intro level).

Discrete vs Continuous probability distributions.

6. Introduction to Statistics
Population vs Sample.

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation).

Inferential statistics basics.

7. Sampling
Why sampling is needed.

Types: Random, Stratified, Systematic, Cluster sampling.

Sample size determination.

8. Sample Means & Sample Sizes
Law of Large Numbers.

Central Limit Theorem (basic idea).

Effect of sample size on accuracy.

9. Additional Basics (Recommended Before/Alongside)
Basic Python for Data Science

Lists, Dictionaries, Pandas, NumPy.

Reading CSV/Excel data.

Jupyter Notebook Basics â€“ Running code, documenting work.

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ For data visualization.

Basic Algebra & Statistics Refresher â€“ Summations, proportions, basic probability.
